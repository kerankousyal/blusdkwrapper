/**
 *  `BLUSEncryptedBeacon` objects represent beacons that have been identified as Bluvision encrypted sBeacons.
 *
 *  @discussion Encrypted sBeacon objects hold the telemetry data and identifiers included in encrypted sBeacon advertisements.
 *  The encrypted information is spread over multiple advertisements. The decoding of the received information will begin after
 *  a sufficient number of single advertisements has been received and only if all required security keys have been set. 
 *  The actual telemetry data of the beacon will therefore not be immediately available.
 *
 *  In addition an encrypted sBeacon will change its Bluetooth address on every rotation . Once that happens its current `BLUSEncryptedBeacon`
 *  representation may become invalid and a new instance may be found by the `BLUBeaconManager`.
 *
 *  If the change of the Bluetooth address could be recognized internally the appropriate `BLUSEncryptedBeaconDelegate` delegate method
 *  will be invoked and no new instance of `BLUSEncryptedBeacon` will be created. This is usually possible if the beacon was successfully
 *  decoded at least once.
 *  @see BLUSEncryptedBeaconDelegate
 *
 *  Encrypted sBeacons also contain device information that is only available after connecting to the beacon and reading its configuration.
